  <h1>Is It Worth Fixing an Electric Scooter?</h1>

  <section>
    <p>
      As a general rule, repairing an electric scooter makes financial sense when the cost of repair
      is significantly less than the cost of a replacement. Repairs that cost less than half the price
      of a comparable new scooter are usually justified, while expensive components like batteries and
      controllers often tip the scale toward replacement. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

    <h2>When Repairing Typically Makes Sense</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Flat tires, worn brake pads, or minor mechanical issues</li>
      <li>Loose cables or simple electrical adjustments</li>
      <li>Parts costing under a modest threshold of total value</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>When Replacement Is Usually the Better Choice</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Battery replacement on older models</li>
      <li>Controller or wiring issues with multiple components</li>
      <li>Frame cracks or structural damage</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In online communities, owners often say the repair isn’t worth it when the cost approaches what
      you’d pay for a new scooter. Especially for major electrical or battery work, replacement can
      be more cost-effective. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
